## WTF
I made this just to confirm that I was correctly reading Japanese characters.

Yes, it's 2025 â€” I probably should've used some kind of AI for this.

But I didn't.



## How to use
Just add this extension 
select some text and press - `ctrl+b` or click the extension icon




I'll probably add some settings to change the shortcut, voice, speech speed etc. <b><i>later</i></b>
